            <h2>Full Description</h2>
            Ketchup Anarchy is a PVP survival Minecraft sever open to all. It has no rules so griefers, robbers and spammers are welcome to do their worst. Honest players looking for a challenge are recommended to bury their bases deep, and their valuables even deeper.
            <br>
            <br>No OPs or moderators means that players will not be silenced or banned. Additionally I am dead against any method of cheating such as the spawning of items in the game. Don't ask for resources, you won't get them. Don't ask for a TP, it won't happen. Don't ask for OP status, I will never consider it.
            <br>
            <br>Being Vanilla means the server delivers the true survival experience. There are no commands to help you move around, no controls to stop creepers blowing up in your face, and no pay-to-win donation features to complicate gameplay.
            <br>
            <br>Server information will be kept up to date at https://ketchupanarchy.github.io/
            <br>
